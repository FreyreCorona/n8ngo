## n8ngo

n8ngo is a set of Go libraries for interacting with n8n, designed to be simple, composable, and explicit.


## Philosophy

This project follows long-standing Go ecosystem principles:

Small packages with clear responsibilities

Explicit dependencies

No hidden magic

APIs that read clearly in code

Each package can be used independently, while sharing a common base client.

*If you only need webhooks, you should not pay for workflows.*
*If you need everything, the pieces fit together naturally.*


## Project status

The project is currently under active construction:

- The API is not stable yet and may change without notice until v1.0.0 is reached.
- APIs may change
- Names are not final
- Documentation is in progress
- Backward compatibility is not guaranteed before v1.0.0.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially in the form of:

- Design discussions
- Well-described issues
- Small, focused pull requests
- Documentation improvements

For large changes, opening an issue first to discuss the approach is recommended.
